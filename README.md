# Mini Game: Number Guessing Game

This is a mini game I built using **React Native** and **Expo** where you pick a number, and the app tries to guess it, see how quickly the app can guess the number you chose.

## Key Learnings & Concepts Applied:

While building this game, I learned and revisited the following React Native concepts:

- **Constants**: Using constant files (like `Colors.js`) to manage values such as colors, text sizes, or other static data
- **Project Structure**: Organizing the files effectively
- **Fonts**: Using `useFonts` from `expo-fonts` to load custom fonts
- **Safe Area**: Implementing `SafeAreaView` and `SafeAreaProvider` from `react-native-safe-area-context` for proper display on all devices
- **UI Components**: Learned how to utilize `ImageBackground`, `LinearGradient` from `expo-linear-gradient` for visually appealing backgrounds andor gradients
- **Dynamic Screen Rendering**: Changing the screen content based on state. For example, using conditional rendering to switch between different screens
- **User Input**: Using `TextInput` for user interaction
- **Alerts**: Triggering `Alert` for feedback and notifications
- **Data Handling**: Using `isNaN()` for number validation
- **Icons**: Adding icons using `Ionicons`
- **Side Effects**: Managing side effects with `useEffect`
- **Performance Optimization**: Implementing `useCallback` to optimize functions that depend on specific state values, minimizing unnecessary re-renders
- **Splash Screen**: Implementing a launch screen with `SplashScreen` from `expo-splash-screen` for a smooth startup experience
- **List Rendering**: Revising `FlatList` and key handling for lists

This project helped me reinforce key concepts in React Native and further improved my understanding of state management, and handling user interactions.
